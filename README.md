# CoffeeScript support for your ember app
Adds precompilation of CoffeeScript files and all the basic generation
types to the `ember generate` command.

### Includes
- Generating files in CoffeeScript with `ember generate`
- Preprocessing CoffeeScript-files in your app

### Install
```
npm install ember-cli-coffeescript --save-dev
```

**NB**: Preprocessing works with ember-cli version `0.0.37` and up.
Generating works with `0.0.39` and up.

### How to use
Run `ember help generate` to get a list of available blueprints.
Use them by running `ember g <blueprint> <args>`, for instance `ember g
controller pants type:array`

### Roadmap
- [ ] Add Coffeescript linting
